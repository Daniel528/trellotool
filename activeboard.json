It is great to be able to **spot all unestimated cards with one click** and keep the scrum board estimated at all times. It is also extremely useful to get an **overview of the amount of points currently allocated in each Trello column**. This feature comes very handy when trying to understand whether we're putting too much work on our shoulders for our next sprint or whether it's possible to increase our scope.*\n- Valentino Giudice (PM **Natural Cycles**)\n\nScreenshots\n-----\n\n ![Points picker](https://getcorrello.com/manifests/agiletools/images/set_points.png)\n\n![Points on cards and lists](https://getcorrello.com/manifests/agiletools/images/list_points.png)\n\n![Migrate points](https://getcorrello.com/manifests/agiletools/images/migrate_points.png)\n\n\n![Set WIP limits](https://getcorrello.com/manifests/agiletools/images/wiplimits.png)\n\n\n![Features GIF](https://getcorrello.com/manifests/agiletools/images/agiletools.gif)\n\n\n![tag](https://pixel-geo.prfct.co/sseg?add=10374642&source=js_tag&a_id=52651)![tag2](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1829177177394829&ev=PageView&noscript=1)","locale":"en-US","name":"Agile Tools"},"icon":{"url":"https://getcorrello.com/manifests/agiletools/images/agiletools-logo-black.svg"},"isCompliantWithPrivacyStandards":null,"tags":[],"url":"https://getcorrello.com/manifests/agiletools/manifest.json","supportEmail":"support@getcorrello.com","moderatedState":null,"public":true,"privacyUrl":"https://getcorrello.com/privacy","name":"Agile Tools","iframeConnectorUrl":"https://getcorrello.com/manifests/agiletools/index.html","categories":["developer-tools","it-project-management"],"capabilities":["board-buttons","card-buttons","card-badges","card-detail-badges","show-settings","callback","on-enable"],"author":"Corrello","idOrganizationOwner":"566167c929b8987b730fe8c9","id":"59d4ef8cfea15a55b0086614"}},"type":"enablePlugin","date":"2019-03-20T07:06:08.588Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5a9149b7c9d7cb4f72fb1195","avatarHash":"","avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"Jin Xiang Hooi","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"JH","nonPublic":{},"nonPublicAvailable":false,"username":"jinxianghooi"}},{"id":"5c91e658a630d602a577aa46","idMemberCreator":"5c7f7aea028d8e76f45020b4","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"VYfbKJNo","name":"Alfalfa Design","id":"5c7f75353ec3004dd3e48a4a"},"plugin":{"usageBrackets":{"boards":1000000},"listing":{"overview":"Visualize Trello cards in a calendar view.","description":"Bring perspective to due dates with the Calendar Power-Up for Trello.
